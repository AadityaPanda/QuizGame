## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11**: Make sure Python 3.11 is installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-game.git
   cd quiz-game
   ```

2. **Run the quiz game**:
   ```bash
   python quiz_game.py
   ```

## Customization

The quiz game is easily customizable. To add or modify questions, simply edit the `quiz_data` list in the code:

```python
quiz_data = [
    {
        "question": "What is the capital of France?",
        "options": ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Rome"],
        "answer": 3
    },
    {
        "question": "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
        "options": ["Earth", "Venus", "Mars", "Jupiter"],
        "answer": 3
    },
    {
        "question": "Which element has the chemical symbol 'O'?",
        "options": ["Oxygen", "Gold", "Osmium", "Helium"],
        "answer": 1
    }
]
```

Each entry in `quiz_data` is a dictionary containing:
- **`"question"`**: The question text.
- **`"options"`**: A list of four answer choices.
- **`"answer"`**: An integer (1-4) representing the correct option's position.

---

## Code Structure

- **`ask_question(question, options, answer)`**: Function to display a question and its options, take user input, and check if it’s correct.
- **`run_quiz()`**: Main function that loops through the list of questions, tracks the score, and displays feedback.
- **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: Ensures that `run_quiz()` only executes if the script is run directly, allowing future import and integration into larger projects.

## Example Usage

Here’s what an example game session might look like:

```plaintext
What is the capital of France?
1. Berlin
2. Madrid

2. Venus
3. Mars
4. Jupiter
Your answer (1-4): 3
Correct!

Quiz Over!
Your final score is 1/2.
